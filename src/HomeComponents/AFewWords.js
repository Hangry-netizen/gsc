      <br />
      <p className="color-beach light">1. We affirm that marriage is not for all and is not the most important part of our life (following God is!), and singleness is not a disease or problem to be cured or solved. We also believe marriage is part of God’s design for humanity and marriage is one of the greatest delights and sanctifiers that God has prepared for those made in His image. Marriage provides the gift of procreation as well as the gift for companionship, as both are God’s grace for us to flourish in His mission for this world.</p>

      <p id="links-in-a-few-words" className="Essays1743 color-red padding-left">Read: Single also good, married also good. Marriage with children also good. Marriage without children also good - all ages welcomed. We receive all as graces from God.</p>
      <p className="color-beach light">2. We affirm that we are all sinful and broken human beings, work in progress on this side of eternity. We also believe diversity is God’s taste. We regard effort is as important as compatibility in marriage. Willingness to invest in a relationship in dating is comparative to readiness to do so in marriage.</p>
      {/*supposed to be a link */}
      <p id="links-in-a-few-words" className="Essays1743 color-red padding-left">     Read: Nobody’s perfect. A world where everyone’s the same is boring. Marriage is hard work. Start now.</p>
      <p className="color-beach light">3. We value healthy relationships and believe that God intends for us to journey in community on this pilgrimage. We hope that you can explore this platform with a simple desire to make friends. Not all good people are suitable life partners. If we all gain one more good brother/sister to journey together from this platform, that would be as good! What drives this platform is friends that come from the place of love. We ask that you only put in honest and sincere entries, honor the people you encounter remembering they are, like you, God’s precious children, and be clear with your intentions. Be thankful to friends who help you along this journey, but ultimately the decision is yours - don’t blame your friends if it doesn’t work out. If no friendship is gained, at least don’t loose a friend! And please remember to respect your friend’s heart and privacy - premature teasing can be destructive.</p>
      {/*supposed to be a link */}
      <p id="links-in-a-few-words" className="Essays1743 color-red padding-left">     Read: Don’t stress and relax, get acquainted on this journey of life! Don’t “ghost”, don’t “breadcrumb”, don’t “flake”: respectingly end things if it’s not working, if it’s friendship and not romance for you tell it as it is, don’t say things you don’t mean to be nice. Thank your friend who urge you/sign you up. Don’t tell others of your friend’s involvement without his/her consent, and avoid unnecessary teasing.</p>
